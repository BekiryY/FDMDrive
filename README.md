## üß© Overview

**FDMDrive** is an open-source experimental vehicle platform built for:
- Autonomous navigation and mapping
- Object detection and tracking
- Embedded drive electronics development
- Control algorithm testing (PID, dynamic acceleration, etc.)
- Integration with basic **ROS** environments

The chassis, drivetrain, and gear system are **100% custom 3D-printed (PLA + TPU)**, including structural parts and wheel design.
